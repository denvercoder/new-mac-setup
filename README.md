    - (Optional) I like to use CMD + Space to activate so you need to turn off that key combo for spotlight.
      - System Preferences > Keyboard > Spotlight
      - Uncheck the two checkboxes    
    - Open Alfred
        - General > Launch Alfred at login
        - General > Alfred Hotkey: Set to CMD + Space
    - Powerpack users
        - Features > Clipboard: Check "Keep Plain Text", "Keep Images", "Keep File Lists"
4. Homebrew
    - First get command line tools for Xcode installed
        - Run the following command in your terminal `xcode-select --install`
        - enter this in the terminal and hit enter: `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
